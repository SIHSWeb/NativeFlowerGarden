              </p>
                <p>Pig face, Carpobrotus edulis also commonly known as the “ice plant” or “sour fig” is a succulent plant, native to South Africa. The pig face is characterised by its thick, fleshy leaves that sometimes have a slight wax coating which range from bright green to bluish-green in colour. The vibrant flowers which bloom mainly in the summer come in shades of pink,purple, or white. After flowering, they produce a small, greenish-brown fruit resembling a fig which is edible and has a tangy flavour.</p>

                        <p><b>Where it grows </b><br>
                              The pig face thrives in a variety of well-drained soils, including sandy, loamy, and rocky soils. It grows well across a range of soil pH levels, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. Pig face plants are commonly found along Australia’s southern and southwestern coastlines, from New South Wales through Victoria to South Australia, as well as along the southwestern coast of Western Australia. Sydney and Melbourne feature pig faces in parks, gardens, and coastal reserves. They can also be found in coastal areas of Tasmania, although less frequently. This plant is valued for its role in erosion control projects as its spreading growth habit helps with stabilising sandy soils. It is also popular in urban landscaping for its decorative appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
                        <p><b>Nutritional value identified by First Nations People </b><br>
                          First Nations Peoples utilised pigface for its substantial health benefits, which align with its chemical properties. The fruit's high water content, which was about 90%, was traditionally used to maintain hydration. It is also rich in vitamin C which is crucial for immune function and skin health. Its dietary fibre supported digestive health by promoting regularity and gut health. Additionally, pigface’s antioxidants, including flavonoids and polyphenols, helped reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. The fruit's essential minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, were valued for supporting bone health and muscle function. These traditional uses are well-supported by the fruit's nutritional content.</p>
                       
<p><b>How we use  (your fruit) today </b><br>
                              Today, pig face is valued for its many uses. Its high water content and tangy flavour enhance dishes and preserves and its rich vitamin C content makes it a key ingredient in supplements for immune health. Its water-rich nature supports hydration products, while its dietary fibre helps with digestive health. Pig face is also used in skincare because the antioxidants in the plant help protect and rejuvenate the skin. The plants spreading growth and drought resistance are utilised in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover. These uses reflect the pig faces traditional benefits and its versatility in modern applications.</p>
                    <p><b>Why we should farm (your fruit) </b><br>
                          Farming pig face in Australia offers many benefits for our agriculture, especially for our country’s challenging climate and environmental conditions. Its ability to thrive through droughts and saline conditions makes it perfect for Australia’s variable climate. The pig faces adaptability to poor, sandy or rocky soils reduces the need for extensive soil amendments. The spreading growth habit helps control soil erosion and stabilised land, making this plant a valuable resource for managing coastal and inland erosion. The high market demand for its culinary and health benefits provides diverse revenue opportunities, and its low maintenance requirements such as requiring minimal water and inputs help with lowering production costs. The pig face also supports sustainable farming practices by enhancing biodiversity and aligns with Indigenous practices, adding cultural significance to its cultivation.</p>
