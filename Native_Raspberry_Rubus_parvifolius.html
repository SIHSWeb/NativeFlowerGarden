                              The Australian native raspberry is a native plant to Australia, commonly found in coastal regions. This typically includes parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It thrives in well draining soils and is known to be tolerant of harsh drought conditions. The Australian native raspberry grows on a shrub that spans up to 1 - 2 meters.</p>
                        <p><b>Nutritional value identified by First Nations People </b><br>
                          First Nations Australians have long recognized the Australian native raspberry as a valuable food source, with traditional knowledge highlighting its nutritional benefits. The fruit is particularly rich in antioxidants, especially anthocyanins and Vitamin C, which are natural pigments that contribute to its vibrant color. These compounds have been extensively studied and are known for their antioxidant properties. The berry’s ability to fight against diseases was first recognized by First Nations people. Because anthocyanins can neutralize free radicals, they may help protect cells from damage. This can contribute to improved heart health, reduced inflammation, and enhanced cognitive function. Also, the Australian native raspberry contains other essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals like folate, a vitamin important for blood cell formation and healthy cell growth. It also contains significant amounts of potassium which help reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>

                    <p><b>Why we should farm (your fruit) </b><br>
