                        <p><b>Where it grows </b><br>
                              Apple berries grow best in well-drained soils, particularly sandy loam, and are commonly found in the woodlands, forests, and coastal regions of southeastern Australia. They are naturally adapted to a range of environments, from New South Wales all the way to Victoria and Tasmania making them resilient to different soils and varying climates.</p>
                        <p><b>Nutritional value identified by First Nations People </b><br>
                              The First Nations people have known the nutritional values of this fruit for a long time, using them as sources of nourishment and medical treatment. One of the essential vitamins that this fruit contains is Vitamin C which is very important because it strengthens, the immune system and carries antioxidants that prevent inflammation.  Graeme Sait an expert nutritionist identified that this fruit had high levels of phenolic compounds which possess “anti-diabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-obesity effects” making them an essential fruit to plant and harvest. Moreover, First Nations people would use the natural sugars in the fruit as quick energy boosts, aligning with the sustainability values of their tradition. </p>
                        <p><b>How we use  (your fruit) today </b><br>
                              Today apple berries are used in many culinary products. The berries can be eaten raw as well as being implemented into salads, or used in desserts and created into jams, because of their mouth-watering taste, but their taste isn’t the only reason for their use. Their nutritional values make them great alternatives for healthy foods and dietary supplements.</p>
                        <p><b>Why we should farm (your fruit) </b><br>
                              Given the current changing climates, with decreasing rainfall and increasingly poor soil quality, apple berries are a great crop choice for farmers. Their adaptability to various soil types and water tolerance make them perfect for sustainable farming practices. Furthermore, as consumer demand grows for native foods that give both nutritional benefits and a sweet taste, apple berries have a chance of becoming a dominant fruit. By incorporating apple berries into their crop selection, farmers can diversify their produce, enhance soil health because of reduced chemical use and genetically modified seeds, and create a new opportunity in the market.</p>
