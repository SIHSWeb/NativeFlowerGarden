                <p>The Australian Native Grape ( Cissus Hypoglauca ), is a large wood climber with yellowish flowers. This plant produces black or purple grapes with 1-2 cm in diameter. It is distinct in their tangy flavor and unique nutritional values. Indigenous Australians have recognised this plant for a very long time, as a food source and for medicinal purposes. &nbsp;</p>

                              The Australian native grape grows in rainforest regions along the eastern coast of Australia. It is well suited to rich and well drained soil, however, it can also thrive in drier areas. This plant is a highly adaptable plant as it can survive from dense forests to urban cities. Nutritional Value Identified by First Nations People.</p>

                        <p><b>How we use  (your fruit) today </b><br>
                              The Australian native grape is now used in many popular health foods, antioxidant rich energy bars and supplements. Its distinct flavor has also been used by chefs in sauces and desserts and beverages.</p>
                    <p><b>Why we should farm (your fruit) </b><br>
                          There are several other benefits of growing the Australian native grape, especially considering the harsh Australian agricultural conditions. Due to climate instability, reduced rainfall, and poor quality of soils, there may be a shortfall in agricultural supplies in times to come. The Australian native grape is a good species to grow on different types of soils with minimal water. Besides, in health-promoting foods, there is increasing demand. With this crop, the farmers could easily penetrate this market with a high demand product.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the Australian native grape holds potential even in modern agriculture, if not for cultural preservation. By understanding its traditional uses and nutritional benefits, we can appreciate the importance of farming this crop.&nbsp;</p></td>
