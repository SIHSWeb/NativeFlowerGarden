                        <p><b>Where it grows </b><br>
                              Lomandra Hystrix can be grown throughout eastern Australia. It is most commonly grown near the coast, creeks, and boggy areas. Lomandra Hysterix can be grown in a wide range of soil from light (sandy) to heavy (clay) soil, as there is no special pH level, or soil it should be grown in because its long thin-spreading roots make it easy to grow anywhere. Lomandra Hystrix can be grown anywhere from minimal amounts to high amounts of sun. It requires low-to-minimal maintenance and attention.</p>
                        <p><b>Nutritional value identified by First Nations People </b><br>
                          The Indigenous Australians commonly used Lomandra Hystrix for weaving baskets because the leaves of the plant are sturdy, bendy and thin enough to be used to weave with. However, there are many other uses for Lomandra Hystrix. One of the most common uses is as a bushtucker. Surprisingly, pulling the leaves in the centre of the plant out carefully reveals a white fleshy part at the bottom of the leaves. First Nations people would wash the clumps in the nearby stream and then chew the white base. It tastes like sweet peas and has a crunchy texture. The leaves are full of fibre and various nutrients. As well as the leaves, Indigenous Australians would eat the white-grey kernels inside the seeds because the seeds are full of carbohydrates and are very nutritious.</p>
                       
<p><b>How we use  (your fruit) today </b><br>
                              Lomandra Hystrix is still used around Australia for many reasons. One of the main uses is as a low-lying, landscaping plant. It is also used to hold soil in place because of the long roots. But, there are many other uses for it, it could be used as a gluten-free substitute for flour. The seeds could be used as a substitute for nuts due to the high levels of carbohydrates and proteins.</p>
                    <p><b>Why we should farm (your fruit) </b><br>
                          Australia should farm Lomandra as an easily available substitute. Because the plant itself is low-maintenance and can adapt to various places it is planted in, it is an easy and cheap substitute it also is it is extremely drought-hardy, requiring minimal watering or attention after being established in a garden. Lomandra Hystrix has many uses, from used as food to weaving baskets to landscaping. It can grow in places with high water, to places that use very little water and requires little to no feeding and fertiliser. As a landscaping plant, Lomadra is amazing as it can grow anywhere and can feed off water runoff.</p>
